🎯 Project Overview

Problem Statement:
Building a music streaming application presents several technical challenges:

- Managing complex state across multiple screens and features like song's favorite status.
- Implementing secure user authentication and data storage.
- Handling audio streaming with efficient memory management.
- Creating a responsive UI that works across different screen sizes.

Solution Approach:

This application addresses these challenges through:

🏗 Clean Architecture Implementation

- To create this app SOLID principles are used.
- Separation of concerns using data, domain, and presentation layers having independent business logic that's easily testable and maintainable, and used GetIt for clear dependency flow to make the codebase scalable.

📊 Efficient State Management

- Using BLoC pattern for predictable state flows
- Implementing cubits for small scale and simpler state management scenarios.
- Maintaining clear separation between UI and business logic.

🎵 Optimized Audio Handling

- Custom audio player implementation with precise controls like play and pause, and also drag feature.
- Efficient streaming from Firebase Storage.

✨ Key Features

- Authentication & User Management

- Animated splash screen with Spotify logo.
- Light and dart theme selection.
- Email/password authentication using Firebase Auth.
- Secure token management and persistence.
- Protected routes and authentication state management.
- Personalized user profiles.
- Input validation and error handling.

🎵 Music Player Engine

- Full-featured audio player with play/pause controls
- Progress bar with drag feature
- Real-time progress tracking
- Precise seeking functionality
- Beautiful song cover art display
- Display of song details like - Song Title and Artist Name

📚 User Library System

- Favorite songs list functionality
- Real-time synchronization with Firebase
- Easy navigation between songs

🎨 Theme Management

- Dynamic theme switching (Light/Dark mode)
- Persistent theme preferences
- Real-time UI updates using BLoC pattern
- Custom theme implementation

📱 UI/UX Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design
- Tab-based navigation for different sections:

 - News
 - Videos
 - Artists
 - Podcasts



🛠 Technical Implementations

Architecture & Design Patterns
